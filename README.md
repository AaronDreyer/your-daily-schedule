# Work Day Scheduler: your daily schedule

## Description

This is a workday scheduler that allows the user to see the current local time and type there schedule using time blocks based on a 9 hour day (9am - 5pm). These time blocks have a text area and save button so the user can type their schedule in based on the hour they are wanting to have it completed/reminded and save it to the browsers local storage. After exiting or refreshing the website, the text the user entered will still be present. Also there is a color code system that highlights the current hour (time block) as red, past hours as gray, and future hours as green.
